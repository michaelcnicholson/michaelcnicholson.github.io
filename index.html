Hi, My name is Michael Nicholson and I am currently in school, at Wake Tech Community College for an IT degree.<br>
	I have a wide array of skill sets, Tableau, web page development, Live 2d cubism, and more. <br> I am a U.S. Army Veteran, where I used to create multiple topographical maps to help DSCA and FEMA.<br>
	<br><p>These series of webpages are here to help you get to know me and see my previous works. These works include two Tableau dashboards, which are indicitive of the housing market in the UK. I created this dashboard during a class on Udemy, a college like certification website. I do have a technical support certificate, achieved through Coursera, another college-like website. 
		Please check out the <nav><a href=Previous_Works.html>Previous_Works</a></nav> if you are curious about the visualizations.
